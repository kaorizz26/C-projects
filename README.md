Welcome to my repository for C language projects!

In this repository, you will find a collection of various projects implemented in the C programming language. As an aspiring programmer, I have created these projects to enhance my understanding of C and to apply the concepts I have learned.

Project List: 

1. Temperature Conversion: A simple program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

2. Vowel Counter: A program that counts the number of vowels in a given input string.

3. Linear array Search: An application that allows users to input elements into an array and then searches for a specific number using linear search algorithms.
